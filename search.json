This workshop will get you up and running with Git and GitHub and teach you how to use some of the most powerful features. By the end of this workshop, you will be able to use Git and GitHub in the browser to create GitHub repositories; fork repositories, add content, and push back to the main repository; browse the state of your repository content at points in the past; make releases; and organize a project using GitHub issues and a project board. No prerequisites besides a GitHub account. Bring a laptop to access GitHub via a browser.\nToday will a mini-hackathon, mini as in 4-hour. As a group, we will produce a series of markdown pages on attractions near our St Louis hotel. Everyone will be assigned to a 3-4 person team that will work jointly on a GitHub project board and then on a markdown document on their team’s topic topic."

Construction was completed in 1965. It was created to document St. Louis’s role in the westward expansion.\nForest Park officially opened to the public in 1876 and still is one of the largest urban parks in the United States. It was created because the Missouri legislature passed an ordinance to establish three parks in the county in 1874. Most of the land was originally virgin forest, which is where the park received its name.\nLafayette Park was set aside in 1936 and dedicated in 1851 as the first public park in the city of St. Louis. Many historians believe this is the oldest urban park west of the Mississippi. The cannons were added to the park in 1897. They are from a British ship that went aground after entering Charleston Harbor in 1776. American ships quickly attacked and sunk it. The cannons from it were later retrieved and sold.\nText with bold, italic, and hyper-linked text.

In two of these championships, the Browns met the Chicago White Stockings, now the Chicago Cubs, launching the enduring Cardinals–Cubs rivalry.\nIn 1892, the Browns, also called the Perfectos, joined the National League.\nIn 1900, the team was renamed the Cardinals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey played in St. Louis from 1995 to 2015 season, before relocating back to Los Angeles, where the team had played from 1946 to 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 10, 2006, the Cardinals opened their new 46,000 seat retro-style downtown ballpark with a 6-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers. The Cardinals also became the first team in almost 100 years to win a World Series Championship in the inaugural season of a new ballpark. The new Busch Stadium hosted the 80th MLB All-Star Game, in July 2009.\n\n700 Clark Ave, St. Louis, MO 63102\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dome at America’s Center is a multi-purpose stadium used for concerts, major conventions and sporting events in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Previously known as the Trans World Dome from 1995 to 2001 and the Edward Jones Dome from 2002 to 2016, it was constructed largely to lure a National Football League (NFL) team back to St. Louis and to serve as a convention space.\n\n\nThe Dome at America’s Center has hosted numerous major conventions, trade shows and exhibitions as well as events as varied as rock concerts, motocross races and monster truck rallies. In 1999, The Dome at America’s Center hosted a Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II, which was the largest indoor gathering ever held in the U.S. The facility has also played host to a number of large-scale amateur and professional sporting events, including the 2005 NCAA® Men’s Final Four®.\n\n\nThe Dome received its initial main tenant with the arrival of the NFL’s St. Louis Rams, who relocated to the city in 1995. The Rams spent the next twenty-one seasons at the Dome, departing after the 2015 NFL season to return to Los Angeles. The St. Louis BattleHawks of the revived XFL began play at the stadium in early 2020.\n\n\nThe Dome provides multiple stadium configurations that can seat up to 82,624 people.\n\n701 Convention Plaza, St. Louis, MO 63101\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing a spectator is great, but St. Louis has plenty of recreational activities if you want to get in on the action yourself!\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nPublic swimming pools: Plenty of options for the family! \nKayaking: Care for a nice, cool evening during the hot summer months? Want a little exericse while you’re at it? Take a break and go for a water front cruise!\nTennis courts: Lots of fun places around the city area to practice your super serve! \nPickleball courts: A hot, up and coming sport! Lebron James just bought a league!\n\n\n\n\nThere is a running group in St. Louis: the Arch City Run Club. I couldn’t see when and where they run without access to Facebook.\n\n\n\nThere’s a 5K route near the Missouri Botantical Gardens. See image below for route."
