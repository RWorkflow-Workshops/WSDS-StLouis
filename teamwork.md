# Team work

During the last 2 hours of the workshop, the participants worked on tasks from their team project board to write sections of their team markdown file in their own branch. Then they merged their work together. All work was done in the browser. Participants did not need to download anything.

1. Team (3 participants) developed some ideas and tasks and put those on their project board.
2. Each team member created a branch for them to work on.
3. Each team member grabbed a task from the board, moved to working on column, and then began editing their team markdown file, e.g. `bridges.md`.
4. One by one, and working together, each team member did a pull request and merged content into the main branch.
5. The team worked together to resolve merge conflicts in the browser via the GitHub resolve merge conflict page.
